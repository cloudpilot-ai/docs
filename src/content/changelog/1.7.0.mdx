# October 2024 - V1.7.0

‚ú®‚ú®‚ú® The most recent release brings some solid new features, enhancements, and bug fixes that should enhance your experience. Check out what's changed:

### üöÄ **Highlights**
- **Workload-Level Minimum Spot Node Scheduling Control**: Utilize the label `workload.cloudpilot.ai/spot-min-nodes` to specify the minimum number of spot nodes for pod scheduling. This feature helps distribute pods of one workload(Deployment/StatefulSet) across multiple spot nodes, preventing over-concentration on a single node. The default setting is 2, and the minimum allowed value is 1.
- **Instant Node Template Updates**: Changes to node templates now take effect instantly, allowing for faster adjustments and improved cluster optimization.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Enhancements
- **Error Reporting**: CloudPilot AI now provides detailed error messages when optimization calculations fail, offering clearer insights into process interruptions and helping troubleshoot issues more efficiently.
- **Multi-Arch(arm64 and amd64) Awareness**: When using multi-arch or single-arch, we're defaulting to what you're using.
- **Manual Cluster Architecture Configuration**: Add support for manual configuration of target node instance architectures on the node template page, giving you more control over your setup.

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes
- **Correct Instance Type Creation**: Create CPU nodes when needed, avoiding unnecessary GPU node creation for CPU-only tasks.

We hope these updates contribute to a more efficient and user-friendly experience with CloudPilot AI. Please feel free to reach out through our [Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T073TAAS5FW/C073J7ECB9C) if you have any questions or need assistance.
