Karpenter is an open-source node lifecycle management project built for Kubernetes. Adding Karpenter to a Kubernetes cluster can dramatically improve the efficiency and cost of running workloads on that cluster. Karpenter works by:

* **Watching** for pods that the Kubernetes scheduler has marked as unschedulable.
* **Evaluating** scheduling constraints (resource requests, nodeselectors, affinities, tolerations, and topology spread constraints) requested by the pods.
* **Provisioning** nodes that meet the requirements of the pods.
* **Disrupting** the nodes when the nodes are no longer needed.

Learn more about Karpenter and how to get started below.

<Callout type="info">
To support the community's growth, the following non-sensitive data will be uploaded to the CloudPilot AI server when the Karpenter AlibabaCloud Provider is installed:
- The instance types of nodes at component launch.
- The cluster's resource usage (CPU/Memory).
- The cluster's resource requests (CPU/Memory).
- The cluster's resource capacity (CPU/Memory).
- The cluster's interruption events for spot instances.
- The cluster's ID as the unique identifier.

This data-sharing feature is enabled by default, but you can disable it by setting the `--telemetry-share=false` flag or the environment variable `TELEMETRY_SHARE=false`.
