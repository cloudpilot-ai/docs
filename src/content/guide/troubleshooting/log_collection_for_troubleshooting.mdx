# Log Collection for Troubleshooting
This document provides a procedure to collect CloudPilot AI component logs from a Kubernetes cluster. The logs contain detailed operational information for troubleshooting CloudPilot AI-specific issues, such as why nodes are provisioned or de-provisioned. These logs do not include any sensitive system information.

## Export Collected Log Steps

1. **Connect to the target Kubernetes cluster** with administrative privileges.
2. **Export collected logs for sharing**:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n cloudpilot port-forward svc/cloudpilot-workload-log-collector-svc 8080:8080 & PID=$!; timeout=10; found=0; while [ $timeout -gt 0 ]; do if nc -z -w 1 localhost 8080 2>/dev/null; then found=1; break; fi; sleep 1; ((timeout--)); done; [ $found -eq 1 ] && curl -s http://localhost:8080/logs > "logs_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).tgz" || echo "Timeout"; kill $PID 2>/dev/null; wait $PID 2>/dev/null
   ```
   **Command breakdown**:
   - Establishes a port-forward tunnel to the `cloudpilot-workload-log-collector-svc` service.
   - Waits up to 10 seconds for the service endpoint to become reachable.
   - Uses `curl` to fetch logs via the exposed HTTP endpoint.
   - Saves logs as a timestamped `.tgz` file (e.g., `logs_20231015143045.tgz`).
   - Gracefully terminates the background port-forward process.

   After running this command, you will get one tgz file containing the detailed logs (e.g., logs_20231015143045.tgz). You can now share it with the CloudPilot AI Support team for any further questions.

If you encounter issues while exporting logs, please check the following:
- Your Kubernetes context is set to the correct cluster.
- The `cloudpilot-workload-log-collector-svc` service exists (`kubectl -n cloudpilot get svc`).
- Your permissions allow port-forwarding and pod access in the `cloudpilot` namespace.

## Security Considerations

The logs contain operational metadata (e.g., pod statuses, API call traces) but exclude:
- SSensitive workload data, such as pod environment variables
- Secrets or credentials
- Network traffic payloads
