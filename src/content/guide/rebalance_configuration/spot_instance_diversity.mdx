# Improving Cluster Resilience with Spot Instance Diversity Management

This document outlines a feature designed to enhance Kubernetes cluster resilience when leveraging Spot instances. By intelligently distributing workloads across heterogeneous instance types, the system reduces operational risks while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

## Key Features

### Automated Instance Type Diversification
CloudPilot AI dynamically distributes workloads across multiple Spot instance types (e.g., `m5`, `t3`, `c5`) within its built-in node provision strategy. This reduces the possibility of simultaneous interruptions and improves cluster resilience even during sudden Spot market volatility.

### Cost-Stability Balance
Achieves an equilibrium between Spot instance cost savings and workload reliability. CloudPilot AI adapts to real-time Spot instance market conditions without requiring manual intervention.

## How It Works

The core logic is implemented in the optimizer component, which monitors the distribution and provisions diverse instance types. Here is one example:

1. **Initial State Analysis**
   The system evaluates current cluster composition. For example:
   | Instance Type | Allocation |
   |---------------|------------|
   | `m5.large`    | 60%        |
   | `t3.medium`   | 20%        |
   | `c5.xlarge`   | 20%        |

2. **Gradual Redistribution**
   New workloads are redirected toward underrepresented instance types. Over time, the distribution evolves toward:
   | Instance Type | Allocation |
   |---------------|------------|
   | `m5.large`    | 40%        |
   | `t3.medium`   | 30%        |
   | `c5.xlarge`   | 30%        |

The actual performance depends on real-time Spot market conditions and regional instance availability. This feature is not enabled by default. Contact the CloudPilot AI Engineering Team for activation.
