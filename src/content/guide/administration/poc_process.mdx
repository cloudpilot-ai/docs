# CloudPilot AI POC Process

This guide outlines the POC process for evaluating CloudPilot AI cluster optimization effectiveness and stability through systematic data collection and analysis.

## Prerequisites

Ensure CloudPilot AI is installed and configured in your target cluster before starting.

## POC Process

The complete POC requires approximately 15 days with phased migration:

**Phase 1 - Workload Migration (3 days):** Migrate representative workloads across backend, frontend, and middleware tiers to establish baseline stability metrics.

**Phase 2 - Node Migration (12 days):** Execute gradual node migration: single node (2 days) → 3 nodes (2 days) → 50% of nodes (5 days) → all remaining nodes (3 days). Validate stability at each stage.

## Stability Assessment

Monitor different workload types appropriately:
- **Web APIs:** Use external monitoring to ensure endpoint availability ([reference](https://docs.cloudpilot.ai/guide/tips/monitor_availability))
- **Databases:** Run on non-spot instances to avoid migration-related failures  
- **Controllers:** Monitor pod pending states—ensure none remain pending \>2 minutes
- **Jobs:** Track retry ratios, maintain \<10% for acceptable stability

## Optimization Evaluation

**Before POC:** Configure workload/Node Pool/Node Class specifications, review optimization plans, and document predicted cost savings.

**After POC:** Compare actual costs against pre-POC projections to validate prediction accuracy.

## Next Steps

Upon satisfactory results, extend CloudPilot AI to additional clusters. Successful POC demonstrates improved scaling efficiency, reduced waste, and measurable cost reduction.
