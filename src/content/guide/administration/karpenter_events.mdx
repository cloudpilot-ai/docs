# Karpenter Events

CloudPilot AI consolidates Karpenter controller events (disruption and provisioner) together with NodeClaim events into a single, correlated view. This unified view helps you visualize node lifecycles, explain create/replace/delete decisions, and quickly diagnose failed node operations.

## Controller events

Controller events are grouped by controller type (disruption or provisioner) and by operation (create, replace, delete).

Key fields:

| Parameter | Description | Value |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| type | Karpenter controller type | disruption, provisioner |
| operationType | Operation performed by the controller | create, replace, delete |
| reason | Reason the event was triggered |  |
| nodeClaimNames | Related NodeClaim names |  |
| nodeClaimIDs | Related NodeClaim IDs |  |
| deletedNodeClaimNames | Deleted NodeClaim names |  |
| deletedNodeClaimIDs | Deleted NodeClaim IDs |  |
| schedulableFailedPods | Pods that failed scheduling |  |
| processTime | Processing time |  |
| status | Operation outcome | true, false |
| errs | Error details (if any) |  |
| data | Raw event payload and details |  |

## NodeClaim events

NodeClaim events include apply and delete operations and expose the details needed to audit and troubleshoot NodeClaim lifecycle actions. These correspond to node addition (apply) and node deletion (delete) events, reflecting the underlying node creation and removal activities.

Webhook alerting for NodeClaim events is currently in a limited canary rollout and is not yet generally available. It supports HTTPS and Lark as delivery channels. If you'd like early access or want this enabled for your environment, please contact [our support team](https://www.cloudpilot.ai/en/contact/) to request enablement and configuration.

Key fields:

| Parameter | Description | Value |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| nodeClaimName | NodeClaim name |  |
| nodeClaimID | NodeClaim ID |  |
| type | NodeClaim event type | apply, delete |
| nodeName | Associated node name |  |
| processTime | Processing time |  |
| status | Operation outcome | true, false |
| errs | Error details (if any) |  |
| data.providerInfo.providerReq | Original request sent to the cloud provider |  |
| data.providerInfo.providerResp | Original response returned by the cloud provider |  |
| data.nodeClass | Related NodeClass |  |
| data.nodeClaim | NodeClaim resource associated with the event |  |
