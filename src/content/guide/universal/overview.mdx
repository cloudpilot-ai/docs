# Overview

**CloudPilot AI Universal** enables you to optimize Kubernetes clusters running on any Kubernetes distribution,
including on-premises infrastructure and other public Cloud providers.

## What is CloudPilot AI Universal?

CloudPilot AI Universal brings CloudPilot AI's core optimization features to any Kubernetes environment.
It focuses on workload optimization and efficient resource utilization through the following capabilities:

* **Workload optimization** - automatically adjusts resource requests and limits based on actual usage patterns
* **Cost savings recommendations(Coming soon)** - generates actionable recommendations to reduce Kubernetes spending

While standard CloudPilot AI takes direct control of node provisioning,
CloudPilot AI Universal integrates with your existing autoscaling infrastructure,
achieving substantial cost reductions via workload optimization.
