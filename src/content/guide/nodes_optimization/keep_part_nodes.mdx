# Keep Some Existing Nodes and Exclude Them from Optimization

In some scenarios, users may want to keep certain nodes:
- Some nodes are on an annual or monthly subscription, and they have not yet expired. These nodes should be kept until their subscription ends.
- Some nodes are Reserved Instances (RI) or Savings Plan (SP), and the contract has not yet expired. These should also be kept until their contract ends.

<Callout type="info">
- **Reserved Instances (RI)**: Prepaid instances with significant discounts for a 1- or 3-year commitment to a specific instance type and region.  

- **Savings Plan**: A flexible commitment-based discount model that applies to various instance types and regions over 1 or 3 years.
</Callout>

By following the steps below, you can selectively optimize only a part of the nodes.

## Install CloudPilot AI

Before proceeding, please install CloudPilot AI by following the instructions in the [Quickstart guide](/guide/getting_started/getting_started). However, remember to only execute the first three steps.

## Add Annotations to Nodes

Add annotation `karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt: "true"` to the nodes you want to keep. For example:

```sh
$ kubectl get node
NAME                       STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
node-01.172.16.0.167       Ready    <none>   60m    v1.31.1-k8s.1
node-02.172.16.3.212       Ready    <none>   2m8s   v1.31.1-k8s.1

$ kubectl annotate node node-01.172.16.0.167 karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt=true
node/node-01.172.16.0.167 annotated
```

Once you've annotated the nodes, go to the console, and you'll see the annotated node will be kept:

## Start Cluster Optimization

Now, click the `Start Saving` button. CloudPilot AI will begin optimizing only the nodes that are not annotated. In the end, you will see that only the un-annotated nodes are optimized.
