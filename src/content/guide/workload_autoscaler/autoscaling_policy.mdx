# AutoscalingPolicy

**AutoscalingPolicy** defines **which Workloads** should have their **Requests and Limits** automatically adjusted, **when** these adjustments should occur, and **how** they should be applied.
By properly configuring a AutoscalingPolicy, you can continuously adjust the Requests of a group of Workloads to a reasonable and efficient level.

> **Note:** Fields marked with * are required.

## Enable*

**Enable** toggles whether an **AutoscalingPolicy** is active (enabled by default).

When set to Disabled, the policy is removed from the cluster and retained only on the server. This operation effectively deletes the **AutoscalingPolicy** and will trigger the **On Policy Removal** actions.

## Priority

When multiple AutoscalingPolicy match the same Workload, **Priority** determines which policy takes precedence.

- A AutoscalingPolicy with a **higher Priority** value will be applied first.
- If two AutoscalingPolicies have the **same Priority**, the one created earlier will be applied.

The **Priority** field allows you to flexibly apply AutoscalingPolicies across your workloads.

For example:

- You can configure a AutoscalingPolicy with **Priority = 0** that matches most or even all Workloads but does not actively adjust them.
- Then, you can define additional AutoscalingPolicies with **higher Priority values** to target specific Workloads with more aggressive adjustment strategies.

## Recommendation Policy Name*

The **RecommendationPolicyName** specifies which **Recommendation Policy** the AutoscalingPolicy should use to calculate recommendations.
It defines both the calculation method and the applicable scope.

For details, see [Recommendation Policy](./recommendation_policy).

## TargetRefs

**TargetRefs** specify the scope of Workloads to which the AutoscalingPolicy applies.
You can configure multiple TargetRefs to cover a broader set of Workloads.

| Field          | Allowed Values                     | Required | Description                                                                                                                   |
|----------------|------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **APIVersion** | `apps/v1`                          | Yes      | API version of the Workload. Only `apps/v1` is supported.                                                                     |
| **Kind**       | `Deployment` \| `StatefulSet`      | Yes      | Type of Workload. Currently supports `Deployment` and `StatefulSet`.                                                          |
| **Name**       | Any valid Workload name \| *empty* | No       | Name of the Workload. If left empty, it matches **all Workloads** within the namespace or cluster (depending on `Namespace`). |
| **Namespace**  | Any valid namespace \| *empty*     | No       | Namespace of the Workload. If left empty, it matches **all namespaces** in the cluster.                                       |

## Update Schedule

**UpdateSchedule** defines **when** a Workload should use a particular update mode.

- Items listed **later in the schedule** have higher priority.
- If no schedule matches, the default mode is `Off`.

By configuring multiple Update Schedule Items, you can apply different update modes at different times.
For example:

- During the day, only allow updates using the `OnCreate` mode.
- At night, allow updates using the `ReCreate` mode.

### Update Schedule Item

| Field      | Allowed Values / Format                        | Description                                                                                                             |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Name`     | Any non-empty string                           | Human-readable name of this schedule item.                                                                              |
| `Schedule` | Cron expression (e.g., `0 2 * * *`)            | Start time defined by a cron schedule. Must follow standard cron syntax. Must be **provided together with** `duration`. |
| `Duration` | Go/K8s duration string (e.g., `30m`, `1h`)     | Length of time the `mode` remains active after `schedule` triggers. Must be **provided together with** `schedule`.      |
| `Mode`     | `OnCreate` \| `ReCreate` \| `InPlace` \| `Off` | Update behavior to apply when this item is active.                                                                      |

**Constraint:** `schedule` and `duration` are **jointly optional** — either **both present** (time-windowed rule) or **both absent** (always applicable rule with the specified `mode`).

### UpdateMode

| Value      | Behavior                                              | Typical Use Case                                                                |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OnCreate` | Apply changes only when new Pods are created.         | Safe, no disruption to existing Pods.                                           |
| `ReCreate` | Apply changes by recreating Pods (rolling replace).   | When in-place vertical changes are not supported or a clean restart is desired. |
| `InPlace`  | Apply changes in place to running Pods (no recreate). | Minimal disruption on clusters that support in-place resource updates.          |
| `Off`      | Do not apply changes (disabled).                      | Temporarily pause updates.                                                      |

When the `UpdateMode` is set to either `ReCreate` or `InPlace`, the `OnCreate` mode will also be applied automatically. This ensures that when a Pod restarts normally, the newly created Pod will always receive the latest recommendations, regardless of the Drift Thresholds.

> **Note:** The `InPlace` mode has certain limitations and may automatically fall back to `ReCreate` in some cases. For details, see [InPlace Limitations](./best_practices_and_limitations#inplace-update-mode-limitations).

## Update Resources*

**UpdateResources** defines which resources should be managed by the Workload Autoscaler.
Available resources: `CPU` / `Memory`.

- You must select at least one resource.
- Only the selected resources will be actively updated.
- This setting does **not** affect how recommendations are calculated.

If you don’t have specific requirements or if you already use HPA, we recommend allowing **both CPU and Memory** to be managed.

> **Note:** After optimizations have been applied, changing Update Resources will not roll back modifications that are already in effect. By default, we do not recommend updating this field. Instead, create a new AutoscalingPolicy and gradually replace the existing configuration.

## Drift Thresholds

**DriftThresholds** define the deviation between the recommended value and the current value that should trigger an active update.

- You can configure this as either a **percentage** or an **absolute value**.
- The default is **10%**.

| Resource Type | Percentage | Absolute Value (Option 1) | Absolute Value (Option 2) |
|---------------|------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **CPU**       | `20%`      | `0.5`                     | `200m`                    |
| **Memory**    | `10%`      | `0.25Gi`                  | `500Mi`                   |

If the deviation for **any resource** in a Pod exceeds the threshold, the Pod will be actively updated.

## On Policy Removal

**OnPolicyRemoval** defines how Pods are rolled back when a AutoscalingPolicy is removed.
- The default is `Off`: the configuration will be deleted, but no action will be taken on existing Pods.

| Value      | Behavior on policy removal                                                                     | Business impact             | Recommended scenarios                                                                        | Notes                                                                                                     |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Off`      | Delete the EVPAC configuration only; **do not** roll back Pod **requests** (status quo).       | No restart, zero downtime   | When rollback is not required; keep current resource settings after troubleshooting.         | **Limits** are unchanged. This option makes no changes to requests/limits.                                |
| `ReCreate` | Roll back to the pre-policy **requests** by **recreating** target Workloads (rolling replace). | Restarts, brief downtime    | Cluster does not support in-place vertical changes; require scheduler to reassign resources. | Ensure safe rolling strategy. **Limits** typically remain unchanged unless your controller handles them.  |
| `InPlace`  | Roll back to the pre-policy **requests** via **in-place** Pod updates (no recreate).           | Usually zero/low disruption | Cluster supports in-place vertical resizing; prioritize minimal disturbance.                 | Requires cluster/runtime support for in-place updates. **Limits** unchanged unless otherwise implemented. |

> **Note:** The `InPlace` mode has certain limitations and may automatically fall back to `ReCreate` in some cases. For details, see [InPlace Limitations](./best_practices_and_limitations#inplace-update-mode-limitations). When unexpected situations prevent us from restoring the Pod Request for 10 minutes, we will allow the configuration to be deleted directly without restoring the Pod Request.

## Limit Policy*

**LimitPolicy** defines how Pod limits should be reset.

| Field         | Behavior                                                                   |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RemoveLimit` | Remove Pod `limits` (no CPU/Memory caps).                                  |
| `KeepLimit`   | Keep existing Pod `limits` unchanged.                                      |
| `Multiplier`  | Recalculate `limits` by multiplying with the recommendation request value. |
