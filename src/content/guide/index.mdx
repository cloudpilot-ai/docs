# Introduction

## What's CloudPilot AI?

**CloudPilot AI** is the **#1 managed Karpenter** cloud service with extensive enhancements. **CloudPilot AI** provides a simple way to optimize your cloud spending while delivering advanced FinOps workflows and cost governance for organizations.

We've implemented numerous additional features on top of Karpenter. With just two steps, **CloudPilot AI** can migrate most or even all of your workloads to Spot instances, delivering an average cost savings of 67%.

## Key capabilities include:

### Intelligent Spot Prediction

Automatically shifts workloads to Spot Instances while maintaining stability. CloudPilot AI uses a time-series prediction model trained on large volumes of node data to forecast Spot interruptions up to 45 minutes in advance.

### Mixed Scheduling Policies for Critical Workloads

Easily configure mission-critical workloads to run on a mix of On-Demand and Spot Instances, achieving a balanced trade-off between savings and reliability.

### Event Observability for Karpenter

Gain visibility into Karpenter's decisions with detailed insights into why nodes are created, deleted, or consolidated—making it easier to troubleshoot and optimize autoscaling behavior.

## Upcoming Features (In Development):

### Pod Rightsizing

Dynamically adjusts pod resource requests based on real usage to reduce waste.

### LiveMigration

Enables seamless pod migration between nodes without downtime, improving availability during rebalancing or scaling events.
